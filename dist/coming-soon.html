            <p>Ukraine - is a beautiful country. It is rich in natural resources. The most plentiful land, rivers, seas, forests, mountains, climatic conditions. There is no overpopulation. People are open-hearted and friendly. However, most citizens of our country are on the edge of poverty, many people are left destitute! Such social problems as dependencies, a homelessness, discrimination, inaccessibility of an education are already chronic for us. In the course of the years of our independence, social situation has not become better, and millions of people still need help and support. There are hundreds of thousands who need help right now. Otherwise, they are doomed to homelessness, illnesses, and to senseless death on the streets or in hospitals from the common treatable diseases. </p>
            <p>We understand that these are the system problems and it is impossible to solve them by one organization, or even by many organizations, no matter how powerful they are. And of course, it is impossible to change this situation in 1 year, or even in 5 years. We see our mission in social investment: involving more and more people into the process of organized charity. So and in no other way, by mass involving of average citizens – residents of our country, changing their attitude to a charity through a personal participation on a regular basis, we can approach to the solution of social pressing questions and change the consciousness of people.</p>
            <p>We also believe that an open dialogue and cooperation between non-governmental organizations, business, and the state – is precisely the way which helps to improve the life of the destitute citizens of our country.</p><b>Mission of the Fund</b>
